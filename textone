This is a text document for testing git and github.
This original block of text was added directly to github.

This block of text has been added to a local repository, on my desktop using vim.

The process started with the command:
>git clone https://github.com/nrbcode/testkit.git

Now I will commit these changes to this local repository.
Subsequently I will push the updates to the remote repository on github.
